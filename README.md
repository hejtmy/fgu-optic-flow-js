# fgu-optic-flow-js
Javascript demonstration of the optic flow

Basic JS and CSS taken from the codepan here https://codepen.io/hfer/pen/VQyqLg. Added random elements.


# Requirements
Chrome with experimental features enabled
chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features

The serial interface is ONLY available when in secure context (therefore https, or loaded from localhost). So serving it from hejtmy.com does not work
